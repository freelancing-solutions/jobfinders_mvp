# [Specification Name] - Requirements Template

## Overview

This document serves as a template for creating requirements specifications within the JobFinders MVP system. It provides a standardized structure for documenting functional and non-functional requirements.

## Template Usage Instructions

1. Copy this template to your specification folder
2. Replace all placeholder text in [brackets] with actual content
3. Remove sections that are not applicable to your specification
4. Ensure all requirements have unique identifiers (REQ-001, REQ-002, etc.)
5. Update the implementation status as work progresses
