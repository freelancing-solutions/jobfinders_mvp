# Job Finders MVP - Specifications Directory

## Overview

This directory contains all technical specifications for the Job Finders MVP platform. Specifications follow a structured lifecycle from draft through active implementation to archival.

### Specification Lifecycle
1. **Draft** - Initial requirements gathering and design exploration
2. **Active** - Currently being implemented or referenced for development
3. **Implemented** - Fully implemented and moved to archive
4. **Archived** - Superseded, deprecated, or completed specifications

## Standard Template Reference

All specifications should follow the standard three-file structure:

- **`requirements.md`** - Functional and non-functional requirements
- **`design.md`** - Technical design and architecture
- **`tasks.md`** - Implementation tasks and acceptance criteria

Templates are available in the [`_TEMPLATE/`](./_TEMPLATE/) directory.

## Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for folder names (e.g., `resume-builder-integration`)
- Use descriptive names that reflect the feature domain
- Avoid version suffixes in folder names (use git for versioning)
- Keep names concise but meaningful

## Requirement Numbering Standard

- **Functional Requirements**: REQ-001 to REQ-499
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: REQ-500 to REQ-699
- **Integration Requirements**: REQ-700 to REQ-799
- **Compliance Requirements**: REQ-800 to REQ-899

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Creating New Specifications
1. Copy the appropriate template from [`_TEMPLATE/`](./_TEMPLATE/)
2. Follow the naming conventions
3. Use standard requirement numbering
4. Update this README index

### Updating Specifications
1. Maintain requirement numbering consistency
2. Update implementation status in index
3. Mark completed tasks in tasks.md
4. Consider archiving when fully implemented

### Archiving Specifications
1. Move entire folder to [`_archive/`](./_archive/) directory
2. Create ARCHIVE_REASON.md file explaining the archive decision
3. Update this README to reflect the change
4. Update any cross-references in other specs

### Review Process
- Quarterly review of all active specifications
- Update implementation status based on current development
- Archive completed or superseded specifications
- Ensure all specifications follow current templates

## Archive Directory

Archived specifications are stored in the [`_archive/`](./_archive/) directory. Each archived spec includes an `ARCHIVE_REASON.md` file explaining why it was archived and where to find current information.
