## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Architecture Approach
- **Custom Hook Pattern**: Created `useSavedJobs` hook to centralize saved jobs logic and state management
- **Component Enhancement**: Enhanced existing `JobCard` component rather than creating new components
- **API Integration**: Utilized existing saved jobs API endpoints (`/api/saved-jobs/`, `/api/saved-jobs/export/`)

### 2. State Management Strategy
- **Client-side State**: Managed saved jobs state locally with automatic synchronization with API
- **Optimistic Updates**: Implemented immediate UI updates with rollback on API errors
- **Real-time Sync**: Automatic refetch when jobs are saved/unsaved from other components

### 3. User Experience Design
- **Seamless Integration**: Save functionality available directly in job listings without page navigation
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear save/unsave states with appropriate icons and colors
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and retry mechanisms

### 4. Mobile-First Design
- **Responsive Layout**: Implemented mobile-responsive design using Tailwind CSS classes
- **Touch-Friendly**: Appropriate button sizes and touch targets for mobile devices
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works on all devices with enhanced features on larger screens

## Integration with Jobs Listing and Applications

### Jobs Listing Integration
- **Save Buttons**: Added bookmark buttons to all job cards in the jobs listing page
- **Real-time Status**: Jobs show saved/unsaved status immediately when page loads
- **Instant Feedback**: Users can save/unsave jobs without leaving the jobs listing
- **Consistent UI**: Save functionality matches the established design patterns

### Applications Management Integration
- **Status Tracking**: Saved jobs can be marked as "Applied" to track application progress
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly transition from saved jobs to application tracking
- **Shared Components**: Uses consistent UI components and patterns across features

### Navigation Trio Completion
- **Complete User Journey**: Users can now navigate `/jobs` → `/saved` → `/applications`
- **Consistent Design**: All three pages follow the same design patterns and user experience
- **Cross-Feature Integration**: Jobs saved in listing appear in saved jobs page, can be marked as applied
