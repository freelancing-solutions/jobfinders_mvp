## 1. Architecture Overview

The Unified Notification System employs a microservices architecture with event-driven communication to provide a scalable, reliable, and intelligent multi-channel notification platform. It serves as the central coordination and delivery engine for all user-facing communications.

### Core Design Principles
- **Channel-Agnostic Core**: A central orchestrator that is unaware of the specific delivery mechanisms of each channel.
- **Strategy-Driven Delivery**: Configurable strategies for routing, timing, and fallback.
- **Scalability & Resilience**: Horizontal scaling for all components and fault tolerance through redundancy and circuit breakers.
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing for performance and health analysis.
- **Security by Design**: End-to-end encryption and strict access controls.

## 2. Component Design

### 2.1. Notification Orchestrator
The central brain of the system. It receives notification requests, applies business logic, and dispatches tasks to the appropriate channel managers via the message queue.

- **Responsibilities**:
    - Process incoming notification requests.
    - Evaluate user preferences and delivery strategies (e.g., sequential fallback, smart delivery).
    - Coordinate cross-channel timing and prevent duplication.
    - Handle failure and retry logic at a high level.
    - Integrate with the Personalization Engine for content optimization.

### 2.2. Channel Managers (Email, SMS, Push, etc.)
A set of specialized microservices, each responsible for a single delivery channel.

- **Responsibilities**:
    - Consume messages from the queue for their specific channel.
    - Manage integration with third-party providers (e.g., SendGrid for email, Twilio for SMS).
    - Handle provider-specific API requirements, rate limiting, and error handling.
    - Implement provider failover and redundancy.
    - Report delivery status back to the Analytics Service.

### 2.3. Delivery Engine
Embedded within each Channel Manager, this component handles the low-level execution of message delivery.

- **Responsibilities**:
    - High-performance batch and real-time delivery.
    - Channel-specific content rendering and transformation.
    - Delivery retry logic with exponential backoff.

### 2.4. Template Engine
A shared service for managing and rendering notification templates.

- **Responsibilities**:
    - Store and version control for multi-language, multi-channel templates.
    - Dynamic variable substitution and personalization.
    - A/B testing support for template content.

### 2.5. Preference Manager
Manages all user-facing notification settings.

- **Responsibilities**:
    - Store and retrieve user preferences for channels, frequency, and quiet hours.
    - Enforce user consent and opt-out choices.
    - Provide an API for the UI to manage preferences.

### 2.6. Personalization Engine
An AI/ML-driven service to optimize notification engagement.

- **Responsibilities**:
    - Determine the best channel and time for delivery based on user behavior.
    - Personalize notification content.
    - A/B testing for delivery strategies.

## 3. Data Model
The data model is stored in a PostgreSQL database, with extensive analytics data offloaded to a data warehouse or time-series database.

- **`notifications`**: Stores the core content and metadata of each notification.
- **`notification_deliveries`**: Tracks the status of each delivery attempt across every channel.
- **`notification_preferences`**: Stores user-specific settings.
- **`notification_templates`**: Stores message templates.
- **`notification_campaigns`**: Manages bulk messaging campaigns.
- **`analytics_events`**: Raw event log for analytics processing.

*(Refer to the Prisma schema in the codebase for the detailed and up-to-date schema)*

## 4. API Design
The system exposes a RESTful API for sending notifications and managing preferences.

- `POST /api/v1/notifications`: Send a notification.
- `GET /api/v1/notifications/{id}`: Get notification status.
- `GET /api/v1/users/{userId}/preferences`: Get user preferences.
- `PUT /api/v1/users/{userId}/preferences`: Update user preferences.
- `POST /api/v1/campaigns`: Create and send a bulk notification campaign.

## 5. Integration Architecture
- **Internal Communication**: Asynchronous communication via a central message queue (Kafka is recommended) to decouple services and handle backpressure.
- **External Communication**: Channel Managers integrate with third-party provider APIs. A circuit breaker pattern (e.g., using Istio or a library like `opossum`) will be used to isolate failures.
- **Real-time UI Updates**: A WebSocket connection is maintained for real-time features like in-app notifications.

## 6. Security Architecture
- **Authentication & Authorization**: All API endpoints are secured using JWTs. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) will be used to manage permissions.
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).
- **Compliance**: The system is designed to be compliant with GDPR, CCPA, CAN-SPAM, and TCPA. This includes managing user consent, handling data deletion requests, and providing audit trails.

## 7. Performance and Scalability
- **Scalability**: All services are designed to be stateless and horizontally scalable. Kubernetes will be used for container orchestration and auto-scaling.
- **Caching**: Redis will be used extensively for caching user preferences, session data, and frequently accessed content to reduce database load.
- **Database Optimization**: Connection pooling, read replicas, and proper indexing will be used to ensure database performance.

## 8. Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics**: Prometheus will be used to collect key metrics (e.g., delivery rates, latency, error rates).
- **Logging**: Structured logging (JSON format) will be used across all services, aggregated in a central logging platform like the ELK stack.
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing (e.g., using Jaeger or OpenTelemetry) will be implemented to trace requests across microservices.
- **Alerting**: Grafana Alerting or Alertmanager will be configured for critical alerts on system health and performance.
