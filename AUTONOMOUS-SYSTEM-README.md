# Autonomous Coder Agent System

This document describes the new autonomous orchestrator system that automatically detects issues and runs coder agents to fix them without human intervention.

## 🎯 What It Does

The autonomous system continuously:

1. **Detects Issues**: Runs validation checks every 30 seconds
2. **Launches Agents**: Automatically starts coder agents when problems are found
3. **Implements Features**: Processes pending specs without waiting
4. **Runs Concurrently**: Manages multiple agents working simultaneously
5. **Stays Running**: Continues monitoring until stopped

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### Before (Queue-Based System)
- ❌ Created jobs but waited for manual processing
- ❌ Didn't automatically detect issues
- ❌ Required VSCode extension to work
- ❌ Limited to TRAE environment

### After (Autonomous System)
- ✅ **Detects issues automatically** and launches agents immediately
- ✅ **Runs truly autonomous agents** that work without human intervention
- ✅ **Continuous monitoring** with configurable intervals
- ✅ **Concurrent execution** of multiple agents
- ✅ **Self-healing** - fixes TypeScript errors, test failures, etc.
- ✅ **Feature implementation** - automatically implements pending specs

## 📁 System Components

### Core Files
- **`autonomous-orchestrator.js`** - Main orchestrator that detects issues and launches agents
- **`start-autonomous-system.js`** - Simple launcher script
- **`test-autonomous-system.js`** - Test script to verify the system works

### What It Monitors
- **Guardian validation conflicts**
- **TypeScript compilation errors**
- **Test failures**
- **Pending specifications** in `.kiro/specs/`

## 🛠️ Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start the autonomous system
node .kiro/scripts/start-autonomous-system.js
```

### Test the System
```bash
# Run the test (creates test issues and verifies agents fix them)
node .kiro/scripts/test-autonomous-system.js
```

### What Happens When Started
1. **System starts** and begins monitoring
2. **Immediate validation** runs to check current state
3. **Issues detected** → Agents launched automatically
4. **Pending specs found** → Implementation agents started
5. **Continuous monitoring** continues every 30 seconds

## 🤖 Agent Behavior

### Autonomous Agents
- **Work independently** without asking for permission
- **Make decisions** about implementation approach
- **Handle errors** and retry failed operations
- **Report completion** when finished
- **Time out** after 5 minutes if stuck

### Agent Types

#### Issue Fixing Agents
```javascript
// Launched when problems are detected
{
  type: 'fix_issue',
  issueType: 'typescript_error' | 'test_failure' | 'guardian_conflict',
  issues: [...], // List of detected issues
  priority: 'high' | 'medium'
}
```

#### Feature Implementation Agents
```javascript
// Launched for pending specs
{
  type: 'implement_spec',
  specName: 'feature-name',
  specPath: '.kiro/specs/feature-name',
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
}
```

## 📊 Expected Output

When the system is running, you'll see:

```
🚀 Starting Autonomous Coder Agent Orchestrator...
📁 Root directory: /path/to/project
⏱️  Validation interval: 30s
✅ Autonomous orchestrator started - monitoring for issues...

🔍 Running validation check...

[agent-123-abc]: TASK COMPLETED
✅ Agent agent-123-abc completed task: fix_issue

[agent-456-def]: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
✅ Agent agent-456-def completed task: implement_spec

✅ No issues detected - system is healthy
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Default Settings
```javascript
{
  validationInterval: 30000,    // Check every 30 seconds
  maxConcurrent: 3,             // Run up to 3 agents
  agentTimeout: 300000,         // 5 minutes per agent
}
```

### Custom Configuration
```javascript
const orchestrator = new AutonomousOrchestrator({
  validationInterval: 10000,    // Check every 10 seconds
  maxConcurrent: 5,             // Run up to 5 agents
  agentTimeout: 600000          // 10 minutes per agent
});
```

## 🔧 Claude Code Integration

The system automatically finds and uses Claude Code from TRAE:

1. **Path Detection**: Looks in standard TRAE extension directories
2. **Process Launch**: Starts Claude Code with autonomous permissions
3. **Prompt Injection**: Sends detailed task instructions
4. **Context Attachment**: Includes relevant files automatically

### Claude Code Path Detection
- `C:\Users\Mothetho\.trae\extensions\anthropic.claude-code-2.0.1-universal\resources\claude-code\cli.js`
- Environment variable `CLAUDE_CODE_PATH`

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Agent Boundaries
- **Can Read**: `.kiro/specs/`, `.kiro/architecture/`, `src/`
- **Can Write**: `src/`, `tests/`, `.kiro/_CodeReviews/`
- **Cannot Modify**: `.kiro/prompts/`, `.kiro/scripts/`, specs themselves

### Error Handling
- **Agent Timeouts**: Automatically terminates stuck agents
- **Process Cleanup**: Removes temporary files after completion
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Properly terminates all agents on Ctrl+C

### Validation Safety
- **Guardian Integration**: Only proceeds if validation passes
- **Test Requirements**: Runs tests after fixes
- **Conflict Prevention**: Checks for issues before implementation

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Continuous Development
```bash
# Start the system and let it run while you work
node .kiro/scripts/start-autonomous-system.js
```

### Bug Fixing
- TypeScript errors automatically fixed
- Test failures resolved automatically
- Guardian conflicts addressed automatically

### Feature Implementation
- Pending specs implemented automatically
- Multiple features implemented concurrently
- No manual intervention required

### Code Quality
- Continuous validation
- Autonomous error correction
- Automated testing and fixes

## 📈 Benefits

1. **Zero Wait Time**: Issues fixed immediately when detected
2. **Continuous Improvement**: System gets better over time
3. **Developer Productivity**: Focus on high-level tasks, let agents handle details
4. **Code Quality**: Continuous validation and fixing
5. **Autonomous Operation**: Set it and forget it

## 🚨 Getting Started

1. **Test the system**:
   ```bash
   node .kiro/scripts/test-autonomous-system.js
   ```

2. **Start production use**:
   ```bash
   node .kiro/scripts/start-autonomous-system.js
   ```

3. **Monitor output** - Watch for agent activity and completion messages

4. **Let it run** - The system will continuously monitor and fix issues

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know the system is working when you see:
- ✅ Agents launching automatically when issues are detected
- ✅ TypeScript errors being fixed without intervention
- ✅ Tests being written and passing
- ✅ Features being implemented from specs
- ✅ System reporting healthy status between issues

The autonomous system is now ready to be your tireless coding assistant!
