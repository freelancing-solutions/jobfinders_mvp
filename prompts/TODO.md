# JobFinders MVP - Parallel Development Plan

## Current Implementation Status & Agent Assignments

### üöß Agent 1: Design System (Currently Working)
**Spec:** `design-system`  
**Status:** ~40% Complete - Foundation implemented, standardization pending  
**Priority:** HIGH - Foundation dependency for all UI specs

**‚úÖ Completed:**
- Enhanced theme provider with dark/light mode
- Design token utilities (colors, typography, spacing)  
- Core layout components (PageLayout, SectionLayout, HeroSection)
- Enhanced UI components (Card, Button with variants)
- Theme toggle functionality

**‚è≥ Next Tasks:**
- Page template standardization (auth, marketing, dashboard pages)
- Component documentation and testing
- Cross-browser optimization

### üöß Agent 2: AI Agents (Currently Working)
**Spec:** `ai-agents`  
**Status:** ~25% Complete - Service classes exist, orchestration layer pending  
**Priority:** HIGH - Foundation dependency for AI-powered specs

**‚úÖ Completed:**
- Basic AI service classes (AIAgentSystem, ATSSystem, ResumeBuilder)
- OpenRouter client integration
- Profile analyzer and skills extractor
- Basic API endpoints for AI features

**‚è≥ Next Tasks:**
- Agent orchestration infrastructure
- LLM integration framework
- Base agent framework with session management
- WebSocket support for real-time interactions

### üéØ Agent 3: Notification System (ASSIGNED)
**Spec:** `notification-system`  
**Status:** Ready to start - Assignment document created  
**Priority:** HIGH - Independent implementation, high user value  
**Assignment:** `prompts/AGENT3-NOTIFICATION-ASSIGNMENT.md`

**‚úÖ Existing Foundation (Major Head Start):**
- Basic WebSocket notification system with real-time delivery
- Frontend notification hook and UI components
- Core notification types (application status, job matches, etc.)
- User room management and targeted notifications

**‚è≥ Key Implementation Areas:**
- Database persistence and notification history
- Email notification system (SendGrid/AWS SES integration)
- SMS notification service (Twilio integration)
- User preference management system
- Smart delivery optimization and analytics
- Campaign management and bulk messaging

**Week 1 Priority Tasks:**
1. Database schema implementation for notifications and preferences
2. Email service integration with template system
3. User preference management API and UI

## Next Phase Assignments (After Current Work)

### Phase 2A: Core UX Layer (Requires Design System ~80% complete)
- **jobs-listing** - Enhanced job browsing interface
- **saved-jobs** - Frontend implementation  
- **applications-management** - Frontend implementation
- **dashboard-user-details-fix** - UI improvements

### Phase 2B: Advanced AI Features (Requires AI Agents ~80% complete)
- **resume-builder-integration** - AI-powered resume optimization
- **ats-system-development** - Automated resume scoring  
- **candidate-matching-system** - ML-powered job matching (also needs jobs-listing)

## Immediate Action Plan

### Agent 1 (Design System)
Continue current work on page template standardization and component documentation.

### Agent 2 (AI Agents)  
Focus on agent orchestration infrastructure and LLM integration framework.

### Agent 3 (Notification System)
**ASSIGNED:** Start `notification-system` implementation immediately.
- **Assignment Document:** `prompts/AGENT3-NOTIFICATION-ASSIGNMENT.md`
- **Week 1 Focus:** Database persistence, email integration, user preferences
- **Advantage:** Significant existing foundation to build upon (WebSocket system, UI components)
- **Goal:** Transform basic notification system into enterprise-grade multi-channel platform

## Success Metrics
- **Week 1-2:** Agent 3 completes notification system foundation
- **Week 3-4:** Design system reaches 80% completion
- **Week 4-5:** AI agents reaches 80% completion  
- **Week 5-8:** All three agents can work on Phase 2 specs in parallel

## Critical Dependencies
1. **Design System** ‚Üí jobs-listing, saved-jobs, applications-management, dashboard-user-details-fix
2. **AI Agents** ‚Üí resume-builder-integration, ats-system-development, candidate-matching-system
3. **Jobs Listing** ‚Üí candidate-matching-system (for job data integration)

This plan maximizes parallel development while respecting dependencies and ensures continuous progress across all three agents.
