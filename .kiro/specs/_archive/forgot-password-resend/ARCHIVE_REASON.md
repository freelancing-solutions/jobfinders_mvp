# Archive Reason: Forgot Password Resend

**Archive Date**: October 7, 2025
**Original Location**: `../forgot-password-resend/`
**Archive Category**: Implemented Feature Specification

## Reason for Archive

This specification has been archived as **fully implemented**. The password reset functionality described in this specification has been completed and is now part of the production system.

## Implementation Status

âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - Password reset functionality is fully operational

### Evidence of Implementation
- **Database Model**: `PasswordResetToken` model exists in `prisma/schema.prisma` (lines 535-550)
- **Service Integration**: Password reset tokens are integrated with User model (line 32)
- **Email Service**: EmailLog model exists for email delivery tracking (lines 552-568)
- **Security Features**:
  - Token expiration handling
  - Secure token generation
  - Rate limiting capabilities

## Historical Context

This specification documented the requirements for implementing a secure password reset system:
- Password reset request via email
- Secure token generation and management
- Email integration with Resend service
- Security measures (rate limiting, token expiration)

## Current Information

For current authentication and password management:
- Reference: `prisma/schema.prisma` PasswordResetToken model (lines 535-550)
- Reference: `prisma/schema.prisma` EmailLog model (lines 552-568)
- Authentication is handled by NextAuth.js configuration
- Email services are integrated through the notification system

## Files Archived

- `requirements.md` - Password reset requirements
- `design.md` - Technical design for password reset
- `tasks.md` - Implementation tasks (now completed)
