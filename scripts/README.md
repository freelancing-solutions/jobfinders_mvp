# Critical Integration Orchestration

This directory contains orchestration scripts for implementing the critical integration issues in the JobFinders platform.

## Overview

The integration implementation addresses the critical gaps between the well-implemented individual systems (Candidate Matching, Notifications, Resume Builder) and the main application. The solution follows a phased approach with parallel execution capabilities.

## Quick Start

### Run Full Implementation
```bash
node orchestrate-integration.js
```

### Interactive Mode
```bash
node orchestrate-integration.js --interactive
```

### Execute Specific Phase
```bash
node orchestrate-integration.js
# Then in interactive mode: phase phase1
```

### Execute Specific Task
```bash
node orchestrate-integration.js
# Then in interactive mode: task 1.1
```

## Phase Structure

## Individual Task Scripts

Each task has its own executable script:

```bash
# Phase 1 Tasks
node tasks/task-1-1-database-schema.js
node tasks/task-1-2-api-routes.js
node tasks/task-1-3-event-bus.js
node tasks/task-1-4-websocket.js

# Phase 2 Tasks
node tasks/task-2-1-matching-integration.js
node tasks/task-2-2-resume-integration.js
node tasks/task-2-3-notification-integration.js
node tasks/task-2-4-dashboard-integration.js

# Phase 3 Tasks
node tasks/task-3-1-realtime-matching.js
node tasks/task-3-2-event-notifications.js
node tasks/task-3-3-live-dashboard.js
node tasks/task-3-4-performance-optimization.js

# Phase 4 Tasks
node tasks/task-4-1-integration-testing.js
node tasks/task-4-2-user-acceptance-testing.js
node tasks/task-4-3-performance-testing.js
node tasks/task-4-4-documentation.js
```

## Dependencies

### Task Dependencies
- **Phase 1:** No dependencies (can all run in parallel)
- **Phase 2:** Depends on Phase 1 completion
- **Phase 3:** Depends on Phase 1 & 2 completion
- **Phase 4:** Depends on all previous phases

### System Dependencies
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis (for caching and real-time features)
- Prisma CLI
- Next.js project structure

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/jobfinders"

# Redis
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="https://your-redis-url"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="your-redis-token"

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"

# AI Services
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# File Storage
UPLOAD_DIR="./uploads"
MAX_FILE_SIZE="10485760" # 10MB
```

## Monitoring Progress

### Status Command
In interactive mode, use `status` to see current progress:

```bash
integration> status

📊 Current Status:
   ✅ Completed: 1.1, 1.2
   🔄 In Progress: 1.3
   ❌ Failed:
```

### Execution Plan
Use `plan` to see the detailed execution plan:

```bash
integration> plan

📅 Execution Plan:

PHASE1: Foundation Infrastructure
   ✅ 1.1: Database Schema Enhancement (2d)
   🔄 1.2: API Route Infrastructure (1.5d)
   ⏳ 1.3: Event Bus Implementation (1.5d)
   ⏳ 1.4: WebSocket Infrastructure (1d)
```

## Error Handling

### Automatic Rollback
If a task fails, the orchestration system will:
1. Log the error with detailed information
2. Attempt automatic rollback where possible
3. Continue with other independent tasks
4. Provide clear recovery instructions

### Manual Recovery
For manual recovery:
```bash
# Check failed tasks
integration> status

# Retry failed task
integration> task 1.3

# Continue with next phase
integration> phase phase2
```

## Testing

### Unit Testing
Each task script includes built-in testing:
```bash
node tasks/task-1-1-database-schema.js --test
```

### Integration Testing
```bash
node tasks/task-4-1-integration-testing.js
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Tracking
The orchestration system tracks:
- Task execution time
- Success/failure rates
- Resource usage
- Dependencies resolution

### Performance Benchmarks
- Database schema updates: <5 minutes
- API route creation: <2 minutes
- Event bus setup: <1 minute
- WebSocket infrastructure: <1 minute

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check database connection
npx prisma db pull

# Reset database if needed
npx prisma db push --force-reset
```

#### Permission Issues
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.js

# Check file permissions
ls -la scripts/
```

#### Port Conflicts
```bash
# Check what's running on port 3000
lsof -i :3000

# Kill processes if needed
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Log Files
- `logs/integration.log` - Main orchestration log
- `logs/task-*.log` - Individual task logs
- `logs/error.log` - Error logs

## Best Practices

### Before Starting
1. Backup current database
2. Create a new branch for integration
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Run existing tests to verify baseline

### During Execution
1. Monitor progress regularly
2. Check logs for any warnings
3. Test features after each phase
4. Commit changes after major milestones

### After Completion
1. Run full test suite
2. Verify all integrations work correctly
3. Update documentation
4. Merge to main branch
