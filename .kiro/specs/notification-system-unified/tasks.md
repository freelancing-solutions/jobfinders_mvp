## 1. Implementation Overview
This document outlines the consolidated implementation tasks for the Unified Notification System. The plan is structured in phases to build the system incrementally, starting with a robust foundation and progressively adding channels and intelligent features.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- **TASK-001: Core Service Scaffolding**: Set up the microservices structure for the Orchestrator, Channel Managers, and other core services.
- **TASK-002: Database Schema Setup**: Implement the complete PostgreSQL schema for all notification-related tables, including migrations.
- **TASK-003: Message Queue Integration**: Configure Kafka (or a similar message bus) for asynchronous, event-driven communication between services.
- **TASK-004: Implement Core Orchestrator Logic**: Build the initial version of the Notification Orchestrator with basic request processing and dispatching to the message queue.
- **TASK-005: Implement Preference Service**: Build the service to manage user notification preferences, including the API and database logic.

## Phase 2: Channel Implementation (Weeks 3-5)
- **TASK-006: Email Channel Implementation**: Build the Email Channel Manager, integrate with providers (e.g., AWS SES, SendGrid), and handle email-specific logic like templating and bounce handling.
- **TASK-007: SMS Channel Implementation**: Build the SMS Channel Manager, integrate with providers (e.g., Twilio), and handle SMS-specific logic like compliance and two-way messaging.
- **TASK-008: Push Notification Channel Implementation**: Build the Push Channel Manager, integrate with FCM and APNS, and manage device tokens.
- **TASK-009: In-App & Web Channel Implementation**: Build the services for in-app (WebSocket-based) and web push notifications.

## Phase 3: Orchestration & Intelligence (Weeks 6-7)
- **TASK-010: Implement Delivery Strategy Engine**: Enhance the Orchestrator with configurable delivery strategies (sequential, fallback, etc.).
- **TASK-011: Implement User Context & Personalization**: Integrate the Preference Service and Personalization Engine into the Orchestrator to make intelligent delivery decisions.
- **TASK-012: Implement Duplication Prevention**: Add logic to the Orchestrator to prevent spamming users with duplicate messages across channels.
- **TASK-013: Implement Scheduling Service**: Build the service for handling scheduled and recurring notifications.

## Phase 4: Campaign & Analytics Features (Week 8)
- **TASK-014: Implement Campaign Management**: Build the services and APIs for creating and managing bulk notification campaigns.
- **TASK-015: Implement Analytics Service**: Build the core analytics service to consume delivery events and calculate key metrics.

## Phase 5: Security & Compliance (Week 9)
- **TASK-016: Implement Security Measures**: Implement end-to-end encryption, secure authentication, rate limiting, and audit logging.
- **TASK-017: Implement Compliance Features**: Build features for GDPR, CCPA, and other regulatory compliance, including consent management and data deletion.

## Phase 6: Monitoring, Testing & Deployment (Weeks 10-12)
- **TASK-018: Set Up Monitoring & Observability**: Implement Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards, and Jaeger for distributed tracing.
- **TASK-019: Comprehensive Testing**: Write thorough unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, achieving >90% code coverage.
- **TASK-020: Performance & Load Testing**: Test the system against the defined performance and scalability NFRs.
- **TASK-021: Documentation**: Write comprehensive API, architecture, and operational documentation.
- **TASK-022: Production Deployment**: Deploy the system to production using a zero-downtime strategy.
