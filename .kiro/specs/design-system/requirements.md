# Design System Standardization Requirements

## Project Overview
JobFinders is an AI-powered job board SaaS platform built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui. The platform currently has inconsistent theming and layouts across different pages. This project aims to create a standardized, professional design system that ensures brand consistency and enhances user experience.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Color System Standardization
- **FR-1.1**: Define a consistent color palette for the entire platform
- **FR-1.2**: Implement primary brand colors (blue/indigo gradient system)
- **FR-1.3**: Define secondary colors (green for success, orange for CTAs, purple for premium)
- **FR-1.4**: Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- **FR-1.5**: Support both light and dark themes with consistent color mappings

### FR-2: Typography System
- **FR-2.1**: Establish a consistent typography scale using Tailwind CSS
- **FR-2.2**: Define heading hierarchies (h1-h6) with consistent sizing and spacing
- **FR-2.3**: Standardize body text, captions, and metadata text styling
- **FR-2.4**: Implement responsive typography that scales across device sizes
- **FR-2.5**: Ensure line height and letter spacing optimize readability

### FR-3: Component Standardization
- **FR-3.1**: Create reusable layout components based on shadcn/ui
- **FR-3.2**: Standardize card layouts with consistent padding, shadows, and borders
- **FR-3.3**: Implement consistent button styles with hover states and transitions
- **FR-3.4**: Create standardized form components with consistent validation styling
- **FR-3.5**: Implement consistent navigation and header patterns

### FR-4: Layout System
- **FR-4.1**: Establish a consistent spacing system based on 8px grid
- **FR-4.2**: Create standardized page layouts (hero, content, footer sections)
- **FR-4.3**: Implement consistent container and wrapper patterns
- **FR-4.4**: Standardize responsive breakpoints and layout adjustments
- **FR-4.5**: Create consistent section spacing and divider patterns

### FR-5: Page Template Standardization
- **FR-5.1**: Standardize authentication page layouts (signin, signup, forgot-password)
- **FR-5.2**: Create consistent marketing page templates (about, pricing, contact)
- **FR-5.3**: Implement unified dashboard layouts for all user roles
- **FR-5.4**: Standardize job listing and detail page layouts
- **FR-5.5**: Create consistent error and 404 page templates

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- **NFR-1.1**: Theme switching should not impact page load performance (>90 Lighthouse score)
- **NFR-1.2**: CSS bundle size should remain under 50KB gzipped
- **NFR-1.3**: Component lazy loading should be implemented where appropriate
- **NFR-1.4**: Theme variables should be CSS custom properties for optimal performance

### NFR-2: Accessibility
- **NFR-2.1**: All color combinations must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
- **NFR-2.2**: Focus states must be clearly visible across all interactive elements
- **NFR-2.3**: The system must support screen readers with proper semantic HTML
- **NFR-2.4**: Reduced motion support should be implemented for users who prefer it
- **NFR-2.5**: High contrast mode should be supported

### NFR-3: Maintainability
- **NFR-3.1**: Design tokens should be centralized and easily updatable
- **NFR-3.2**: Component props should be well-documented with TypeScript
- **NFR-3.3**: Theme configuration should be extensible for future brand updates
- **NFR-3.4**: CSS class naming should follow consistent conventions
- **NFR-3.5**: Design system documentation should be comprehensive

### NFR-4: Browser Compatibility
- **NFR-4.1**: Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) latest 2 versions
- **NFR-4.2**: Graceful degradation for older browsers
- **NFR-4.3**: Consistent appearance across all supported browsers
- **NFR-4.4**: Proper CSS fallbacks should be implemented

## Technical Constraints

### TC-1: Technology Stack
- Must use Next.js 15 with App Router
- Must integrate with existing shadcn/ui components
- Must use Tailwind CSS 4 for styling
- Must support Next.js theme switching (next-themes)

### TC-2: Existing Infrastructure
- Must work with existing authentication system (NextAuth.js)
- Must integrate with current database schema (Prisma)
- Must be compatible with Socket.IO real-time features
- Must support existing component library structure

### TC-3: Brand Requirements
- Must maintain professional SaaS appearance
- Must support South African market context
- Must be suitable for job board industry standards
- Must be scalable for future feature additions

## Success Criteria

### User Experience
