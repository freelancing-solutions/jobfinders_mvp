**F2.3** The orchestrator MUST support A/B testing for delivery strategies and channel effectiveness.

**F2.4** The orchestrator MUST handle batch processing for bulk notifications while maintaining individual user preferences.

### F3: User Preference Integration
**F3.1** The orchestrator MUST integrate with user preference systems to respect channel preferences, quiet hours, and opt-out settings.

**F3.2** The orchestrator MUST support dynamic preference evaluation based on user context (device status, location, time zone).

**F3.3** The orchestrator MUST handle global user opt-outs while maintaining audit trails for compliance.

**F3.4** The orchestrator MUST support temporary preference overrides for critical system notifications.

### F4: Message Queue Integration
**F4.1** The orchestrator MUST integrate with message queue systems for scalable notification processing.

**F4.2** The orchestrator MUST support priority-based queue processing with configurable worker allocation.

**F4.4** The orchestrator MUST support scheduled notification processing with precise timing control.

### F5: Analytics and Monitoring
**F5.1** The orchestrator MUST track cross-channel delivery metrics including:
- Channel success rates and failure reasons
- User engagement across channels
- Delivery timing and optimization effectiveness
- Cost analysis per channel and message type

**F5.2** The orchestrator MUST provide real-time monitoring of notification flows and channel health.

**F5.3** The orchestrator MUST generate actionable insights for delivery strategy optimization.

**F5.4** The orchestrator MUST maintain detailed audit logs for all orchestration decisions and actions.

### F6: Template and Content Management
**F6.1** The orchestrator MUST coordinate template selection and content adaptation across channels.

**F6.2** The orchestrator MUST support dynamic content personalization based on channel capabilities and user data.

**F6.3** The orchestrator MUST handle content localization and internationalization across channels.

**F6.4** The orchestrator MUST validate content compatibility with channel-specific requirements and limitations.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NF1.3** The orchestrator MUST maintain 99.9% uptime with graceful degradation during partial service failures.

**NF1.4** The orchestrator MUST implement efficient caching for user preferences and delivery strategies.

### NF2: Scalability
**NF2.1** The orchestrator MUST support horizontal scaling with stateless processing nodes.

**NF2.2** The orchestrator MUST handle dynamic load balancing across processing instances.

**NF2.3** The orchestrator MUST support auto-scaling based on queue depth and processing metrics.

**NF2.4** The orchestrator MUST maintain consistent state across distributed processing nodes.

### NF3: Reliability

**NF3.2** The orchestrator MUST support graceful degradation when individual channels are unavailable.

**NF3.3** The orchestrator MUST maintain data consistency during partial failures and recovery scenarios.

**NF3.4** The orchestrator MUST implement dead letter queues for failed notifications with manual intervention capabilities.

### NF4: Security
**NF4.1** The orchestrator MUST implement secure communication with all downstream notification services.

**NF4.2** The orchestrator MUST validate and sanitize all notification content before processing.

**NF4.3** The orchestrator MUST implement rate limiting and abuse prevention mechanisms.

**NF4.4** The orchestrator MUST maintain audit trails for all orchestration decisions and user data access.

### NF5: Observability
**NF5.1** The orchestrator MUST provide comprehensive metrics for monitoring and alerting.

**NF5.2** The orchestrator MUST support distributed tracing for end-to-end notification flows.

**NF5.3** The orchestrator MUST implement structured logging with correlation IDs for debugging.

**NF5.4** The orchestrator MUST provide health check endpoints for service monitoring.

## Integration Requirements
