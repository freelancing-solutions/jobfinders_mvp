# Agent 3 Assignment: Notification System Implementation

## üéØ Mission Overview
Implement the comprehensive **notification-system** spec to create a multi-channel communication platform for JobFinders MVP. This is a **HIGH PRIORITY** assignment that can start immediately as it has **zero dependencies** on other ongoing work.

## üìä Current Status Assessment

### ‚úÖ Existing Foundation (What's Already Built)
Agent 3 has a **significant head start** with existing notification infrastructure:

**Real-Time WebSocket System:**
- ‚úÖ Basic WebSocket server setup (`src/lib/socket.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Socket.IO integration with notification handlers
- ‚úÖ User room management for targeted notifications
- ‚úÖ Real-time notification delivery system
- ‚úÖ Frontend notification hook (`src/hooks/use-notifications.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Notification dropdown UI component

**Core Notification Types:**
- ‚úÖ Application status updates
- ‚úÖ New job postings
- ‚úÖ Application received notifications
- ‚úÖ Job match notifications
- ‚úÖ Basic notification data structure

**Frontend Integration:**
- ‚úÖ React hook for notification management
- ‚úÖ UI components for notification display
- ‚úÖ Unread count tracking
- ‚úÖ Mark as read functionality

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations (What Needs Enhancement)
- **No email notifications** - Only WebSocket/in-app
- **No SMS notifications** - Missing SMS provider integration
- **No user preferences** - Users can't configure notification settings
- **No notification persistence** - No database storage
- **No delivery optimization** - No smart timing or throttling
- **No campaign management** - No bulk messaging capabilities
- **No analytics** - No tracking of notification effectiveness

## üìã Immediate Action Plan

### Week 1 Tasks (Start Immediately)

#### Task 1: Database Schema Implementation
**Files to Create:**
- `src/lib/database/migrations/004_create_notification_tables.sql`

- `src/services/notifications/email/email-delivery-service.ts`
- `src/lib/email/providers/sendgrid-provider.ts`
- `src/lib/email/email-template-engine.ts`
- `src/app/api/notifications/email/route.ts`

#### Task 3: User Preference System
**Files to Create:**
- `src/services/notifications/preference-manager.ts`
- `src/app/api/users/[userId]/preferences/route.ts`
- `src/components/notifications/preference-settings.tsx`

**Enhancement to Existing:**
- Update `src/hooks/use-notifications.ts` to include preference management
- Enhance notification dropdown to include settings access

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Week 1 Goals:
- [ ] All notifications persist to database
- [ ] Email notifications working for critical events
- [ ] Users can manage basic notification preferences
- [ ] Existing WebSocket system enhanced with new features

### Week 2 Goals:
- [ ] SMS notifications operational
- [ ] Push notifications implemented
- [ ] Advanced preference controls available
- [ ] Notification analytics tracking implemented

### Week 3-4 Goals:
- [ ] Smart delivery optimization active
- [ ] Campaign management system operational
- [ ] A/B testing framework functional
- [ ] Complete notification system meeting all spec requirements

## üîß Technical Guidelines

### Code Standards:
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns in the codebase
- Use Prisma for database operations (existing pattern)
- Maintain compatibility with existing Socket.IO implementation
- Follow existing API route patterns in `src/app/api/`

### Integration Points:
- **Database:** Use existing Prisma setup (`src/lib/db.ts`)
- **Authentication:** Integrate with NextAuth.js session management
- **UI Components:** Use existing design system components
- **WebSocket:** Enhance existing Socket.IO setup, don't replace

### Testing Requirements:
- Unit tests for all new services
- Integration tests for notification delivery
- End-to-end tests for user preference flows

## üìö Key Specification References

**Primary Spec:** `.kiro/specs/notification-system/`
- `requirements.md` - Detailed functional requirements
- `tasks.md` - Complete task breakdown with acceptance criteria
- `design.md` - Architecture and design patterns

**Critical Requirements to Implement:**
- **F1.1-F1.4:** Multi-channel delivery (real-time, email, SMS, in-app)
- **F2.1-F2.3:** Intelligent management and personalization
- **F3.1-F3.3:** Event-driven triggers for job platform events
- **F4.1-F4.2:** Campaign and bulk messaging capabilities

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Build on Existing Foundation:** Don't rebuild the WebSocket system - enhance it
2. **Database First:** Implement persistence before adding new channels
3. **User Experience:** Ensure preferences are intuitive and comprehensive
4. **Performance:** Consider notification volume and implement proper queuing
5. **Compliance:** Ensure SMS and email comply with regulations (TCPA, CAN-SPAM)

## ü§ù Coordination with Other Agents

- **Agent 1 (Design System):** Will provide enhanced UI components when ready
- **Agent 2 (AI Agents):** May integrate AI-powered notification optimization later
- **Independent Work:** This assignment has zero dependencies - proceed immediately
