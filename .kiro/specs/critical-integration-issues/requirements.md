# Critical Integration Issues - Requirements

## Overview

The JobFinders platform has well-implemented individual system components (Candidate Matching, Notifications, Resume Builder) but lacks proper integration, preventing users from accessing the full functionality promised in the original specifications. This implementation plan addresses the critical integration gaps to create a cohesive user experience.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Components Status
- ✅ **Candidate Matching System**: Complete backend services, no UI integration
- ✅ **Notification System**: Complete standalone service, no main app integration
- ✅ **Resume Builder**: Complete services, no API routes or UI integration
- ✅ **Authentication & User Management**: Fully integrated and functional
- ✅ **Job Management**: Complete with database integration

### Critical Integration Gaps
- ❌ No UI for AI-powered job recommendations
- ❌ No connection between resume analysis and job matching
- ❌ No real-time notifications for matching events
- ❌ No unified user experience across systems
- ❌ Database schema doesn't support advanced features
