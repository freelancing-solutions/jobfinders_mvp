// This is the main Prisma schema file for the Job Finders application
// Schema separation implementation - this file imports all schema modules

// Note: Prisma doesn't currently support direct schema imports in the way shown below.
// Instead, this file serves as documentation of the schema separation structure.
// The actual schema files are located in the prisma/schema/ directory.

// To use the separated schemas, you would need to:
// 1. Concatenate all schema files during build time
// 2. Use a schema stitching tool
// 3. Or switch to a database tool that supports schema modules

// For now, the original schema.prisma file has been backed up to:
// prisma/schema-original-backup.prisma

// The separated schemas are:
// - prisma/schema/base.prisma - Core configuration and User model
// - prisma/schema/auth.prisma - Authentication models
// - prisma/schema/jobs.prisma - Job management models
// - prisma/schema/applications.prisma - Application management models
// - prisma/schema/resumes.prisma - Resume and CV models
// - prisma/schema/company.prisma - Company and employer models
// - prisma/schema/billing.prisma - Billing and invoice models
// - prisma/schema/notifications.prisma - Notification system models
// - prisma/schema/analytics.prisma - Analytics and tracking models
// - prisma/schema/templates.prisma - Resume template models
// - prisma/schema/matching.prisma - AI matching system models

// For development purposes, you can use the original schema file or
// concatenate the separated schemas using the build script:

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

// IMPORTED SCHEMAS (concatenated during build):
// Base schema with core configuration and User model
// Auth schema with authentication models
// Jobs schema with job management models
// Applications schema with application management models
// Resumes schema with resume and CV models
// Company schema with company and employer models
// Billing schema with billing and invoice models
// Notifications schema with notification system models
// Analytics schema with analytics and tracking models
// Templates schema with resume template models
// Matching schema with AI matching system models

// To build the complete schema, run:
// cat prisma/schema/base.prisma prisma/schema/auth.prisma prisma/schema/jobs.prisma prisma/schema/applications.prisma prisma/schema/resumes.prisma prisma/schema/company.prisma prisma/schema/billing.prisma prisma/schema/notifications.prisma prisma/schema/analytics.prisma prisma/schema/templates.prisma prisma/schema/matching.prisma > prisma/schema-complete.prisma

// Then use schema-complete.prisma for development
