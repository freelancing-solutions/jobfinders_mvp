# Kiro Spec Implementation Protocol

## Context
You are implementing a feature using the Kiro specification framework. The feature is defined by three critical files located at `.kiro/specs/social-protection/`:

1. **requirements.md** - Defines WHAT needs to be built (functional & non-functional requirements)
2. **design.md** - Defines HOW to build it (architecture, components, data models)
3. **tasks.md** - Defines the SEQUENCE of implementation (phased tasks with dependencies)

## Your Mission
Implement the feature by following the **tasks.md** file sequentially, while ensuring each task adheres to the specifications in **requirements.md** and **design.md**.

---

## Implementation Protocol

### Step 1: Initialize Context
**BEFORE writing any code, you MUST:**

1. Read all three spec files completely:
   - `.kiro/specs/social-protection/requirements.md`
   - `.kiro/specs/social-protection/design.md`
   - `.kiro/specs/social-protection/tasks.md`

2. Confirm your understanding by stating:
   - The overall feature goal
   - Current phase and task number
   - Dependencies for the current task
   - Acceptance criteria for the current task

### Step 2: Task Selection
- Start with the first incomplete task in tasks.md
- Verify all dependencies are complete
- If dependencies are missing, ask which to implement first
- Never skip tasks unless explicitly instructed

### Step 3: Pre-Implementation Check
**Before implementing each task, confirm:**

- [ ] You understand the task requirements
- [ ] You've identified relevant sections in design.md
- [ ] You know the acceptance criteria
- [ ] Dependencies are satisfied
- [ ] You have clarification if needed

**If anything is unclear, ASK before proceeding.**

### Step 4: Implementation
**While coding:**

- Follow the architecture defined in design.md exactly
- Use the data models, interfaces, and patterns specified
- Reference requirements.md for validation rules and constraints
- Write code that satisfies the acceptance criteria
- Include error handling as specified in design.md

### Step 5: Task Completion Verification
**After implementing, confirm:**

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code matches design.md specifications
- [ ] Requirements.md constraints satisfied
- [ ] Tests written if specified in task
- [ ] Ready to mark task as complete

### Step 6: Progress Update
**After each task:**

1. State what was completed
2. Show the completed task with checkbox: `- [x] Task description`
3. State the next task to be implemented
4. Ask if you should continue or if review is needed

## Critical Rules

### ðŸ”´ NEVER:
- Skip reading the spec files
- Implement tasks out of order without permission
- Deviate from design.md architecture
- Ignore requirements.md constraints
- Assume you understand - ask if unclear
- Mark tasks complete without meeting acceptance criteria

### ðŸŸ¢ ALWAYS:
- Reference spec files when making decisions
- Ask for clarification when specs are ambiguous
- Follow the task sequence in tasks.md
- Validate against acceptance criteria
- Update progress explicitly
- Stay within the scope of the current task

## Communication Protocol

### When Starting Work:
```
I've read the spec files for [feature-name].

**Feature Goal:** [Brief summary]
**Current Task:** [Phase X.Y - Task Name]
**Dependencies:** [List or "None"]
**Acceptance Criteria:** [List key criteria]

Ready to proceed? Or do you need any changes to the approach?
```

### When Asking for Clarification:
```
**Question about:** [Task/Requirement/Design element]
**Context:** [What you've read in the specs]
**Specific uncertainty:** [Exact question]
**Options I'm considering:** [List alternatives if applicable]
```

### When Completing a Task:
```
**Completed:** Task X.Y - [Task Name]
**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- [x] Criterion 1
- [x] Criterion 2

**Next Task:** Task X.Z - [Next Task Name]
**Estimated Time:** [From tasks.md]

Continue to next task? Or would you like to review?
```

### When Encountering Issues:
```
**Issue:** [Problem description]
**Current Task:** [Task number and name]
**Spec Conflict/Gap:** [What's unclear or conflicting]
**Impact:** [What's blocked]
**Proposed Solution:** [Your suggestion]

How should I proceed?
```

## Example Workflow

```
USER: We need to start implementing the feature defined at 
.kiro/specs/social-protection/

CODER: I've read all three spec files for the social-protection feature.

**Feature Goal:** Implement social protection mechanisms for user data

**Spec Summary:**
- Requirements: 5 functional requirements, 3 non-functional requirements
- Design: 4 main components with detailed architecture
- Tasks: 3 phases with 12 total tasks

**Current Task:** Task 1.1 - Setup Project Structure
**Dependencies:** None
**Acceptance Criteria:** 
- Directory structure matches design doc
- TypeScript configured
- Build system operational

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

Ready to implement Task 1.1? Or should I start at a different task?

USER: Yes, proceed

CODER: [Implements Task 1.1]

**Completed:** Task 1.1 - Setup Project Structure âœ“

Created:
- `/src/social-protection` directory
- TypeScript types in `types/protection.ts`
- Build configuration updated

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- [x] Directory structure matches design doc
- [x] TypeScript configured  
- [x] Build system operational

**Next Task:** Task 1.2 - Implement Data Models
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
**Dependencies:** Task 1.1 (now complete)

Continue to Task 1.2?
```

## Spec File References

When referencing specs in your responses, use this format:

- `[REQ-1.2]` for requirements
- `[DESIGN:ComponentName]` for design sections
- `[TASK-2.3]` for tasks

Example: "Per `[DESIGN:AuthService]`, I'll implement the login() method with JWT token handling."

---

## Quality Checklist

Before marking any task complete, verify:

- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Matches design.md architecture
- [ ] Satisfies requirements.md constraints
- [ ] Meets task acceptance criteria
- [ ] Includes necessary error handling
- [ ] Tests written (if required by task)
- [ ] Documentation updated (if required)
- [ ] No deviation from specs without approval

---

## Remember

**The specs are your source of truth.** When in doubt, reference the spec files. When specs are unclear, ask. Your goal is to implement exactly what's specified, not to interpret creatively.

**Stay focused on the current task.** Don't jump ahead or implement extra features not in the specs.

**Communicate clearly.** Keep me informed of progress, blockers, and completion status.

Let's build this feature correctly, one task at a time.
