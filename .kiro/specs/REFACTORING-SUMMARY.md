# Specification Directory Refactoring Summary

**Date**: October 7, 2025
**Scope**: Complete refactoring and standardization of .kiro/specs directory
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive refactoring of the `.kiro/specs` directory has been completed to address inconsistencies, resolve conflicts, eliminate redundancy, and standardize formatting across all specification files. Based on verification of the actual codebase implementation, this refactoring reduced the specification count from **28 fragmented specifications** to **13 active specifications** while preserving all essential requirements and business logic.

- **Resume Builder & Template Engine** - Lines 1185-1354 in schema.prisma, extensive services
- **Matching System** - Lines 570-828 in schema.prisma, 30+ files in services/matching/
- **Applications Management** - Lines 1092-1183 in schema.prisma, services exist

**üîÑ Partially Implemented** (active):
